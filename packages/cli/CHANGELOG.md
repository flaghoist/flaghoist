# flaghoist

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- e13bd69: First published release: every package goes out together at 0.1.0.

  The packages are only useful as a set, so releasing a subset would ship broken installs.
  `@flaghoist/server` depends on `@flaghoist/core`, `@flaghoist/vue` depends on
  `@flaghoist/provider-web`, `create-flaghoist` depends on `flaghoist`, and the project the CLI
  generates depends on `@flaghoist/server` plus whichever storage adapter you picked. Any of those
  left unpublished is an install failure for someone following the quickstart.

  `flaghoist --version` now reports the version from `package.json` instead of a hardcoded `0.0.0`,
  so a version in a bug report means something.

  Treat 0.1.0 as an alpha in everything but the version number: it is a real release on `latest` so
  that the documented commands work as written, but the API is not stable and will change.

- 1a638e4: Create the KV namespace during `flaghoist deploy`, so the quickstart works on the first try.

  A fresh project's `wrangler.toml` carried a literal `<your-kv-namespace-id>`, so on the default
  `cloudflare-kv` storage the very first command in the README failed: wrangler rejected the
  placeholder, and nothing in the CLI output or the docs said that `wrangler kv namespace create
FLAGS` had to be run first. The generated file had a comment pointing at it, which you only saw
  after the command had already failed.

  `deploy` now creates the namespace itself and writes the real id back into `wrangler.toml`. It only
  does this while the placeholder is there, so an id you pasted in yourself is never touched and
  repeat deploys reuse the namespace rather than making a new one. If wrangler fails, or prints an id
  this cannot read, the deploy stops with the manual command rather than continuing into a failure.

  `eject` prints the same command, since an ejected project runs wrangler on its own.

- 64c55a3: Add `create-flaghoist`, so `npm create flaghoist@latest team-flags` works.

  npm rewrites `npm create <name>` to the package `create-<name>`, so the command developers
  reflexively type — the convention Vite, Astro, Nuxt and Next all trained them on — was resolving to
  a package that did not exist and returning a 404. It scaffolds the directory (which `flaghoist init`
  does not) and writes `flaghoist.toml` into it.

  The `flaghoist` CLI now also exposes its config helpers (`serializeConfig`, `parseConfig`,
  `DEFAULT_CONFIG`, `STORAGE_KINDS`) as a library entry point. The scaffolder writes the config with
  the same serializer the CLI parses it back with, so the two cannot drift into a file one side
  writes and the other cannot read.

- c58f8e4: Ship the admin dashboard with `flaghoist deploy` and `flaghoist eject`, so `/admin` works out of the
  box.

  The server has always been able to serve the dashboard, through `config.dashboard`, but the CLI
  never set it. A Worker from a fresh `flaghoist deploy` answered `/admin` with "Dashboard not
  configured" and a 404, one line below where the quickstart told you to open it. The message pointed
  at a setting that could not be reached from the path the docs prescribed: there was no dashboard key
  in `flaghoist.toml` and no flag on the CLI.

  `@flaghoist/server` now exports the prebuilt single-file dashboard as `dashboardHtml` from
  `@flaghoist/server/dashboard`, and the generated Worker imports it. It is a separate entry point, so
  a deployment that does not want the UI never pulls the HTML into its bundle.

  The dashboard is on by default. Set `dashboard = false` in `flaghoist.toml` to generate a Worker
  that serves the read and admin APIs alone. Configs written before this release have no such key and
  keep serving the dashboard, which is the documented behaviour.
